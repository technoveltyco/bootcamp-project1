### Screenshots

**Fakee-Shop SiteStripe and header navigation**

![Fakee-Shop SiteStripe and header navigation](./docs/assets/img/Screenshot%202023-02-11%20190532.png)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## Specifications


### Project requirements

1. Must use at least two server-side APIs.
2. Must use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.
3. Must use client-side storage to store persistent data.
4. Must have a polished UI.
5. Must meet good quality coding standards (indentation, scoping, naming, etc.).
6. Must NOT use alerts, confirms, or prompts (look into modals). 
7. Must be deployed to GitHub Pages.

### RESTful APIs 

The website will use Mock-Up APIs for the back-end:

- [Platzi Fake Store API](https://fakeapi.platzi.com/) : for creating the products, filtering and user accounts.
- [Faker API](https://fakerapi.it/en) : For general fake data like companies, credit cards, addresses, etc.
- [ExchangeRate API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/docs/standard-requests) : for currency exchange.

### UX/UI Design

The UX/UI design will follow the specifications of the [High-converting e-commerce UI kit](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1192047659163071392) which defines a retail e-commerce website. The full theme is freely available in the Figma Community.

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("🎉");
};
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own plans for continued development.**
