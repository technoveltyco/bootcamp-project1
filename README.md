## Overview

*Fakee-Commerce* is the leading website offering the best fake shopping experience online.

### The MVP (minimal viable product) concept

Describe the MVP here

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

Here we will explain the details of the design and implementation of the project.
### APIs 

The website will use Mock-Up APIs for the back-end:

- [Platzi Fake Store API](https://fakeapi.platzi.com/) : for creating the products, filtering and user accounts.
- [Faker API](https://fakerapi.it/en) : For general fake data like companies, credit cards, addresses, etc.
- [ExchangeRate API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/docs/standard-requests) : for currency exchange.

### Tasks Done

- [Proof of concept demo using 3 different APIs]() 

### Pending tasks

- [Define the concept for an application that uses these APIs]()
- Define the functional and technical requirements for implementing the application concept.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("üéâ");
};
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.
