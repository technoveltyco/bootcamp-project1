# Epic or User story title

## User Story

_*“As a [persona], 
I [want to], 
[so that].”*_

- *"As a [persona]":* Who are we building this for? We’re not just after a job title, we’re after the persona of the person. Max. Our team should have a shared understanding of who Max is. We’ve hopefully interviewed plenty of Max’s. We understand how that person works, how they think and what they feel. We have empathy for Max.
- *“Wants to”:* Here we’re describing their intent — not the features they use. What is it they’re actually trying to achieve? This statement should be implementation free — if you’re describing any part of the UI and not what the user goal is you're missing the point.
- *“So that”: how does their immediate desire to do something this fit into their bigger picture? What’s the overall benefit they’re trying to achieve? What is the big problem that needs solving?

## Acceptance Criteria

_*Acceptance criteria are a set of statements, each with a clear pass/fail result, that can be measured and specify both functional and non-functional requirements.*_
