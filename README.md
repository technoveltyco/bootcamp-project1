## Overview

*Fakee-Commerce* is the leading website offering the best fake shopping experience online.

### The MVP (minimal viable product) concept

Describe the MVP here

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## Specifications


### Project requirements

1. Must use at least two server-side APIs.
2. Must use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.
3. Must use client-side storage to store persistent data.
4. Must have a polished UI.
5. Must meet good quality coding standards (indentation, scoping, naming, etc.).
6. Must NOT use alerts, confirms, or prompts (look into modals). 
7. Must be deployed to GitHub Pages.
8. Must be interactive (i.e: accept and respond to user input).
9. Create UX/UI with Figma.
10. Create a project Kanban dashboard with agile user stories.

### RESTful APIs 

The website will use Mock-Up APIs for the back-end:

- [Platzi Fake Store API](https://fakeapi.platzi.com/) : for creating the products, filtering and user accounts.
- [Faker API](https://fakerapi.it/en) : For general fake data like companies, credit cards, addresses, etc.
- [ExchangeRate API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/docs/standard-requests) : for currency exchange.

### UX/UI Design

The UX/UI design will follow the specifications of the [High-converting e-commerce UI kit](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1192047659163071392) which defines a retail e-commerce website. The full theme is freely available in the Figma Community. 

Here there are the links to the Figma resources that are being considered in the implementation of the Fakee-Shop:
